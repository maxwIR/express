      <button class="accordion">What is interesting about my life?</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>This is a hard question to answer without plunging into a full-fledged biography. I will do my best to keep it short and concise.</p>
        <p>I was  born in the United States but my family moved to France while I was still an infant. That is where I spent most of my childhood.</p>
        <p>From there we traveled a great deal, going as far as Laos and Tanzania as well as the rest of Europe (though most frequently to the UK, Germany and Austria)</p>
        <p>After completing high school in France, I returned to the United Stated to attend University. That is where I got my Bachelor’s Degree and got back in touch with the American culture.</p> 
        <p>Once I had finished my studies, I spent some time working at jobs that did not meet my life's goals. After about a year trying to make my own way, I decided to venture to greener pastures, moving to Australia to explore new avenues.</p>
        <p>Currently, I do free-lance software and web engineering while working on my own projects.</p>

      <button class="accordion">What are my skills?</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p><b>Languages</b> were always easy for me to learn. Due to my upbringing in a Franco-Austrian-American environment, I am fluent in English French and German. I tried my hand briefly at Russian and then more deeply at Mandarin and have found them much more complex. I am still learning the latter but it is a slow and slightly embarrassing process as the pronunciations are unlike any other language I speak fluently (<i>English</i>, <i>French</i> and <i>German</i>)</p> 
        <p><b>Software Skills</b> are always something I have found easy to pick up. I am proficient to professional with all popular programming languages such as <i>Java</i>, <i>C++</i>, <i>JavaScript</i> and <i>Python</i> though I am most comfortable with the first two. Other technology miscellaneous skills include <i>Desktop Support</i> and use of development platform <i>Unity</i></p>
        <p><b>Anthropology</b> was another of my favorite subjects in college. I learned a large variety of wide-range skills such as <i>ethnography</i> and <i>archaeological field work</i> but also skills such as <i>conflict resolution</i> and <i>culturo-specific biases</i></p>

      <button class="accordion">What am I passionate about?</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>I love solving problems! There are few things as satisfying as resolving a problem that has been wracking my brain. It is one of the many reasons I love developing software solutions but it is also what makes me such a curious individual.</p>
        <p>Perhaps as an extension of this, I love exercising my curiosity. I deeply enjoy learning new skills even if they are completely out of my comfort zone. To me, the most important part of learning these new skills is to be able to apply them in real world scenarios. That is truly where skills are honed and perfected.</p>

      <button class="accordion">What are my hobbies?</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>I have myriad projects going at any one time which are always keeping me busy. The larger projects can be seen on the <a onclick="disp(event, 'Projects')" style="cursor:pointer"><b>Projects</b></a> tab. Otherwise, I hone my software skills in competition against other engineers on websites such as <a href="https://www.codewars.com/" style="cursor:pointer"><u>codewars.com</u></a> and <a href="https://www.codefights.com/" style="cursor:pointer"><u>codefight.com</u></a>. </p>
        <p>My pastimes primarily involve reading. I always loved reading science-fiction and fantasy. Most recently, "The Kingkiller Chronicles" by Patrick Rothfuss has kept me waiting for sequels for three years and is exciting me with the prospect of a movie.</p>
        <p>I also enjoy any kind of gaming. From video games to table-top games, I play it all. The latter of these has what led me to a larger ongoing project for a "smart" character sheet.</p>

      <button class="accordion">High school</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>My high school experience was rather unique. As you may expect of someone of my background, I gravitated to a bilingual school. This school, however, was rather unique. It was a Franco-German School founded to strengthen ties between France and Germany which had developed an Anglophone section as well as quite the reputation as the third best high school in France. It is thanks to its reputation as a world-class high school that the <a href="http://www.fulbright-france.org" style="cursor:pointer"><u>Fulbright Foundation</u></a> converted my high school grades to the United States Equivalent of a 3.6 GPA (i.e A). The program had very high standardsfor languages and learning (English, French and German were considered primary languages and Spanish was the primary foreign language). In 2012, I graduated from this amazing high school and got the Baccalaureate (Option International Britanique).</p>

      <!-- Op2 -->
      <button class="accordion">College</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>My college experience was a bit more conventional. I attended university in the United States for 3 1/2 years. This is where I truly explored the professional options I had been thinking about. I spent my first two years as an undeclared major, exploring all venues of interest which rapidly narrowed down to two which ended up being my areas of focus. After my first year of experimentation, I quickly eliminated the arts, economy, business and eventually psychology. This left me with most of the sciences as well as anthropology. It was after realizing that half the classes I enjoyed were under the Anthropology Department (the other half being under Computer Science) that I decided to make it my major. Once that was settled, it was a matter of juggling my schedule to fit all the right classes to complete my degree in time. The anthropology side was easy to fit in as the classes themselves are only structured into a two or three tiered pre-requisites tree. Unfortunately, the computer science part of my attempted dual degree was not as easy to accommodate. As the classes required multiple prerequisites and the Computer Science Department favored pure computer science majors in terms of registration, I ended up three classes short from the required amount to get the full double degree. Instead of plunging in for an extra two semesters to fit in these three courses, I decided that it would be best to take the computer science part as a minor and learn those skills that I was lacking in the real world where they would be relevant to my profession.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Further Development</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p>I did eventually manage to bridge the knowledge gaps I had by learning more about networking and databases on my own time while working a full-time job. I took an online class with <a href="http://www.champlain.edu/" style="cursor:pointer">Champlain College</a> covering all of TCP/IP in the course of half a semester. This was a very insightful class into networking, the functioning of the internet and network security. Since then, I have been considering furthering my knowledge with a Microsoft Certificate. I am currently working towards a Database Certificate but since more and more data is dynamic rather than static, I am considering switching to an App Creation Certificate.</p>

      <button class="accordion">Pathfinder Tool : SmartChar - IN PROGRESS</button>
      <div class = "panel">
        <p datedata= "December 2016 - Present"><b>Java</b>, <i>Web-scraper and interface project</i></p>
        <p>The initial purpose of this project was to simplify the process of creating and progressing a character in roleplaying-style games. This can sometime be quite messy and time consuming between rolling for score improvements and selecting the right features (that the character matches the prerequisites for). The idea was to have a program that would allow a user to simply select from an organized list of options instead of flipping through the pages of 3 different books. From this, the ambitions of the program extended to include data gathering from the reference websites and making it web and OS compatible. Of course, since the software is still young it is only learning to gather the correct information in the right format but I am sure that it will reach its full potential very soon. If this is a problem you struggle with or that interests you, please do reach out!</p>
        <p>The following are the objectives of the project:</p>
        <li>Implement the java Jsoup and Apache libraries to retrieve information from various webpages</li>
        <li>Use the acquired information and structure it into an Object hierarchy and save the object</li>
        <li>Implement a database back end for XML object files</li>
        <li>Finally, put the acquired information to dynamic use, so as to be accessible by general users</li>
        <li>Future development: make a smooth interface for windows and android access (currently cli only)</li>
